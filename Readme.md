Whanos – Base Java Application

This repository hosts a minimal Java application used as a test project for the Whanos CI/CD pipeline developed in Epitech’s third-year DevOps curriculum.

Its purpose is to provide a simple codebase that Jenkins can:

| Task   | Description                                       |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Track  | Detect commits pushed to this repository.         |
| Build  | Compile using a default Dockerfile.               |
| Deploy | Push the resulting container to Azure Kubernetes. |
